## Test Tools
- Test Tools are designed to make testing easier
- Automate manual activities
- Management tools
  - Help organzie test items and workflows
    - Defect Reports
    - Test Reports
    - Test Cases
    - Test Schedule
    - Requirements Traceability
  - Examples
    - HP ALM
    - JIRA
- Static Testing
  - Static Code Analysis
  - User stories and business rules are often too high level to be interpreted by software
  - Examples
    - Sonar Cloud
- Test Design and implementation
  - Test Data Prep tools
    - Tools that anonymize real user data for use in future tests
  - Examples
    - K2view
- Test Execution and logging
  - Testing Frameworks
  - Examples
    - JUnit
    - Jest
    - Cucmber
- Performance Testing tools
  - Tools that measure speed and efficiency
  - Examples
    - Locust
    - JMeter

### Automated Testing
Utilizing testing tools for creating and executing testings
- Pros
  - Tests Run faster than a human
  - Can be run anytime
  - Produces more objective metrics like a timer or % of code covered
  - Easy to repeat tests 
  - Execute tests without human mistakes
- Cons
  - Requires skilled programmers for many automated testing tools
  - Uusally a significant upfront cost
  - Some tasks can be difficult to automate

- Capture Test Approach
  - A tool is used that allows a tester to manually fulfil a test
  - The tool captures the users' actions 
  - These actions are now automated and can be run at anytime
- Data Driven Approach
  - Data for tests is stored somewhere
  - A script reads that data and executes the tests
