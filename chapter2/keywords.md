# Chapter 2

- acceptance testing,
  - Focuses on behavior and capabilities of a whole system. Objectives include establishing confidence in system quality, validating system completeness and verifying functional and non-functional behaviors.
- alpha testing,
    Testing performed at the developing organization's site by potential and existing customers before software is released to market.
- beta testing,
    Testing performed by potential or existing customers at their own locations. May occur after Alpha testing or without any prior Alpha testing.
- change-related testing,
  - Testing done to confirm that any changes have corrected a defect or implemented desired functionality correctly, and have not caused any unforeseen adverse consequences.
- commercial off-the-shelf (COTS),
  - Software available on the market ready for customer use without any modifications needed.
- component integration testing,
  - Tests to ensure that individual units of code interact together according to specifications/expectations.
- component testing,
  - Also known as unit testing, focuses on components that are separately testable. OFten down in isolation of the rest of the system.
- confirmation testing,
  - After a defect is fixed the application may be tested with all test cases that failed due to the defect, re-executed on the new software version. The software may also be tested with new tests to cover changes needed to fix the defect.
- contractual acceptance testing,
  - Acceptance testing performed against a contract's acceptance criteria for the software. Often performed by users or independent testers.
- functional testing,
  - Tests that evaluate functions that the system should perform
- impact analysis,
  - Evaluating the changes that were made for a maintenance release to identify the intended consequences as well as side effects of a change. This includes identifying which parts of a system are affected by a given change.
- integration testing,
  - Tests focused on interactions between components or systems within the application.
- maintenance testing,
  - Tests that are performed whenever changes are made as part of maintenance. This includes running regression tests to check if any changes made during regular system maintenance have broken or altered the state of the program somewhere else.
- non-functional testing,
  - Testing of a system that evaluates characteristics of systems and software such as usability,
performance efficiency or security
- operational acceptance testing,
  - Acceptance testing of a system by operations of systems administration staff in a simulated production environment. May include things like user management, maintenance tasks, and disaster recovery.
- regression testing,
  - Tests to detect unintended side-effects created when fixing one part of the code accidentally breaks another part of the code somewhere else in a way that wasn't immediately obvious
- regulatory acceptance testing,
  - Acceptance testing performed against any regulations that must be adhered to, such as legal and safety regulations. The results of these tests are sometimes audited by outside regulatory agencies.
- sequential development model,
  - Software development model where every phase follows the previous phase linearly.
- system integration testing,
  - Focuses on the interactions and interfaces between systems, packages, and microservices. System integration testing can also cover interactions with external services, such as web services and APIs.
- system testing,
  - Focuses on the behavior and capabilities of a whole system or product, often considering the end-to-end tasks the system can perform and the non-functional behaviors it exhibits while performing those tasks.
- test basis,
  - Basis for a test. Could be things like a system requirement, a technical specification, or a business process.
- test case,
  - Specified inputs, conditions, procedures, and expected results that define a single test.  
- test environment,
  - An environment containing the  specific software/hardware that is needed to run the test cases. This can be a separate environment or can be an existing development or even production environment.
- test level,
  - Groups of test activities that are organized and managed together.
  1. Component/Unit testing
  2. Integration testing
  3. System testing
  4. Acceptance testing

- test object,
  - What is being tested. Can be an entire application or just individual units of code depending on test level.
- test objective,
  - What you're attempting to verify/validate by testing.
- test type,
  - A group of test activities aimed at testing specific characteristics of a software system, or a part of a system, based on specific test objectives.
- user acceptance testing,
  - Testing focused on validating the systems fitness for use by intended users in a simulated or real operational environment.
- white-box testing
  - Tests based on the systemâ€™s internal structure or implementation. Internal structure may include code, architecture, work flows, and/or data flows within the system.
