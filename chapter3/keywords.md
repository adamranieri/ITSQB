# Chapter 3

- ad hoc review,
  - A review where reviewers are provided with little to no guidance beforehand on how to conduct the review. Highly dependant on reviewer's skills and may lead to duplicate issues being reported by different reviewers.

- checklist-based review,
  - A systematic technique, whereby the reviewers detect issues based on checklists that are distributed at review initiation, usually by the review's facilitator.

- dynamic testing,
  - Testing of an application while it is running.

- formal review,
  - Reviews with documented procedures and results, often with team participation.

- informal review,
  - Reviews that do not follow a defined process and not having a documented structured output.

- inspection,
  - A very formal/structured review conducted by either peers of the author or outside experts from other disciplines. Users follow clearly defined (and mandatory) roles such as moderator, scribe, reviewer, etc. Follow a defined process with formal output documentation based on rules and checklists.

- perspective-based reading,
  - Reviewers take on different stakeholder viewpoints (such as end user, marketing, designer, operations, etc) and often try to generate work products related to the role they are adopting for the review.

- review,
  - A systematic examination of a document or work product done by one or more people to find and remove defects early in the software development process.

- role-based review,
  - Similar to perspective based readings, reviewers evaluate the product from the perspective of different stakeholders. They can be both user types (new user, experienced user, child, senior citizen, etc) and organizational roles (manager, sys-admin, employee, etc.)

- scenario-based review,
  - Reviewers are provided with structured guidelines to read through the work product. REviewers perform dry runs based on the expected usage of the application in the real world by end users.

- static analysis,
  - Examination of the source code of a work product done without actually executing the code. Usually done with the use of tools.

- static testing,
  - In contrast to dynamic testing, static testing relies on the manual examination of work products or a tool-driven evaluation of source code. Ergo, static testing is not performed on a running application.

- technical review,
  - Review led by technical peers of the work product author(s), and/or technical experts in the same or related disciplines. Led by a moderator, and produces defect logs and review reports if defects are found.

- walkthrough
  - A review usually led by the author of a work product, walking participants through use of the application. A scribe is mandatory, but it may be formal or informal depending on team. Can take the form of scenarios, dry runs, or simulations.
