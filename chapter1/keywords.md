# Fundamentals of testing

- coverage,
  - How much of the code is being tested when test protocols are ran.
- debugging,
  - Development activity of hunting, analyzing and fixing defects
- defect,
  - Something that works incorrectly
- error
  - Some mistake
- failure,
  - A requirement is unable to be fulfilled
- quality,
  - Measure of how well software complies to it's intended design
- quality assurance,
  - Maintenance of a certain level of quality through all steps of development to ensure quality in the final product
- root cause,
  - The earliest actions or events that contributed to the creation of  that defect
- test analysis,
  - Analyzing the test basis to identify testable features and define associated test conditions. Answers question of "what to test?"
- test basis
  - Core document that contains elements
  - Elements
    - Functional Requirement
    - Nonfunctional Requirement
- test case,
  - A set of actions performed in sequence to determine if software satisfies requirements and functions correctly.
- test completion,
  - Activities that collect data from completed test activities to consolidate experience, testware, and other relevant info
- test condition,
  - A constraint that should be followed to test an application.
- test control,
  - Taking actions necessary to meet the objectives of the test plan.
- test data,
  - Concrete values to the inputs of a test case as well as expected results.
- test design,
  - Test conditions are elaborated into high level test cases and any associated testing technologies. Answers question of "how to test it?"
- test execution,
  - Test suites are run in accordance with the test execution schedule.
- test implementation,
  - Testware needed for test execution is created/implemented, including sequencing of test cases into test procedures.
- test monitoring,
  - The on-going comparison of actual progress against planned progress using testing plan metrics.
- test object,
  - What is being tested.
- test objective,
  - Reason why a test or testing in general is being conducted. Examples include verifying requirements are fulfilled and finding defects and failures.
- test oracle,
  - A mechanism to determine if a test passed or failed by comparing test output to expected test output when the test is run.
- test planning,
  - Activities that define the objectives of testing and the approach for meeting test objectives within constraints imposed by other context (such as a project milestone deadline.)
- test procedure,
  - Sequence test cases are arranged in when a test suite is run.
- test process,
  - Common set of test activities used by an organization.
- test suite,
  - Automated testing done with test procedures and any automated test scripts.
- testing,
  - A way to asses software quality and reduce risk of software failure during operation.
- testware
  - Code written for testing
- traceability,
  - linking a test to a requirement or set of requirements.
- validation,
  - Checking whether a system meets user and other stakeholder needs in it's real world operational environment.
- verification
  - Checking if a system meets specified requirements
- False Positive
  - A test *fails* due to errors in test data or execution
- False Negative
  - A test *passes* due to errors in test data or execution
- Root Cause Analysis
  - Searching for the progenitor defect that is causing cascading bugs
- KPI
  - Key Performance Indicator - a quantifiable measure of performance over time for a specific objective
